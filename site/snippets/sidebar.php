    <p>Howdy, my name is Bram Smulders and I am a front-end developer. With the greatest pleasure I put tons of my time and energy into <a href="http://github.com/bramsmulders" title="Yeah, i code stuff" class="link--attention">my work</a>. Currently I'm employed as lead Front-end developer for <a href="http://www.freshheads.com" title="freshheads website" class="link--attention">freshheads</a>, a Dutch Web Design and Development Agency.<br> I enjoy myself best while fiddling with markup, CSS & Javascipt. I also keep myself busy with front-end architecture, performance & maintainablity.</p>
