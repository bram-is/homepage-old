I’m Bram Smulders, a Front-end UI developer from Tilburg, the Netherlands.
With a strong focus on accessibility & progressive enhancement I wire up HTML, CSS and JavaScript into rich online experiences.

I’ve been contributing to the web for around {{ '2007-01-01' | timeago: site.time }} and worked with many different companies. These include agencies like [We are you](https://www.weareyou.com/), [E-sites](https://www.e-sites.nl/), [Freshheads](http://freshheads.com) and clients like [Eneco](http://eneco.com), [KNVB](http://knvb.nl), [Quinny](http://www.quinny.nl/), [Dunea](http://dunea.nl) & [Emerce](http://emerce.nl).

I maintain some [repositories on GitHub](https://github.com/bramsmulders) and I’ve created [Supple](https://github.com/supple-css/). It is a small but powerfull CSS framework designed specially with the latest browsers in mind.

Currently I’m employed as Senior UI developer at [We are you ’s-Hertogenbosch](https://www.weareyou.com). We have expertise in strategy, online marketing, customer journeys, design, development and managed hosting.

In the moments where I’m not working I love to spend time with my lovely fiancé Saskia, my 2 kids and my family and friends. The local cinema is treating me like one of the regulars. Occasionally I go for a run around the beautiful dutch countryside.
