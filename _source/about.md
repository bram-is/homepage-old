I’m Bram Smulders, a front-end developer from Tilburg, the Netherlands.
With a strong focus on accessibility & progressive enhancement I wire up HTML<sub>5</sub>, CSS<sub>3</sub> and JavaScript into rich online experiences.

I’ve been contributing to the web for around {{ '2007-01-01' | timeago: site.time }} and worked with many different companies. These include agencies like [Colours](http://colours.nl), [Freshheads](http://freshheads.com) and clients like [Eneco](http://eneco.com), [KNVB](http://knvb.nl), [Quinny](http://www.quinny.nl/), [New Heroes](http://newheroes.com) & [Emerce](http://emerce.nl).

I maintain some [repositories on GitHub](https://github.com/bramsmulders) and I’ve created [Blocss](https://github.com/Blocss/)<sup>(‘Blocks’)</sup>, a small but powerfull css framework designed specially for serious developers.

Currently I’m employed as Lead Front-End developer at [Colours](http://colours.nl) where I’m responsible for a versatile, cross-country and awesome development team.

In the moments where I’m not working I love to spend time with my lovely girlfriend Saskia, my 2 kids and my family and friends. The local cinema is treating me like one of the regulars. Occasionally I go for a run around the beatifull dutch countryside.
