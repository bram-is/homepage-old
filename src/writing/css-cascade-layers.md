CSS Cascade Layers, another tool in the box for working with specificity & the cascade. And a very welcome one at that! Iâ€™m collecting helpfull resources on the topic:

- [A Complete Guide to CSS Cascade Layers](https://css-tricks.com/css-cascade-layers/) by [Miriam Suzanne](https://twitter.com/TerribleMia)
- [Hello, CSS Cascade Layers](https://ishadeed.com/article/cascade-layers/) by [Ahmad Shadeed](https://twitter.com/shadeed9)
- [The Future of CSS: Cascade Layers (CSS `@layer`)](https://www.bram.us/2021/09/15/the-future-of-css-cascade-layers-css-at-layer/) by [Bramus Van Damme](https://twitter.com/bramus)
- [CSS Cascade Layers: An overview of the new `@layer` and `layer()` CSS primitives](https://youtu.be/ilrPpSQJb3U) (YouTube) - By [Una Kravets](https://twitter.com/Una)
- [Polypane](https://polypane.app), one of the first browsers with Cascade Layer support in the devtools

I can see myself using CSS Cascade Layers in a setup like [Structured Front-end components](/writing/structured-frontend-components). Maybe I'll write an article about that in the future.
