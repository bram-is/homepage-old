On the 24th of January in 2017 I will be talking about Atomic Design at the [Fronteers meetup at E-sites](https://fronteers.nl/bijeenkomsten/2017/meetup-januari-e-sites).
It will be the first time I‘ll speak at such an event so I‘m very excited! Talking about [structured Front-end workflows](https://bramsmulders.com/blog/how-i-improved-my-workflow-with-smacss-sass/) however is in my nature and part of my daily work.

## My talk
The talk will be about [Atomic Design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/) and how to incorporate this methodology into your front-end workflow.
I will be rambling about [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io/), components, templating, using data, CSS, a dash of JavaScript and their place in your design system.

## Timetable
* 18:00 · Entry with food
* 18:50 · Introduction and opening words
* 19:00 · Talk 1: Iain van der Wiel - Prevention of complexity in your CSS
* 19:45 · Pause
* 20:00 · Talk 2: Bram Smulders - Atomic design with Pattern Lab
* 20:45 · Drinks

All talks are in dutch, and will take about 45 minutes. There will be a short period of Q & A after each talk.

## Venue
The event will be held at [E-sites](https://www.e-sites.nl/) in the lovely city of Breda, The Netherlands. The event is free of charge and there will be drinks and food!
