Hi, I’m Bram. I’m a front-end UI developer from The Netherlands and I work by the credo “[Solve for one, extend to many](https://medium.com/@leannemdobson/solve-for-one-extend-to-many-inclusive-design-and-why-it-matters-48336f4641a0)”. This means I specialise in scalable code for apps and websites with a strong focus on accessibility, progressive enhancement and powerful, speedy development.
