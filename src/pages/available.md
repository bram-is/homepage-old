I hold myself to high standards, and provide value for the investment you make when hiring me. My work is:

- **Standards-compliant.**
- **Mobile first.** I take a mobile-first approach to building front-ends.
- **Fully responsive**, tested across numerous devices and browsers.
- **Cross-browser compatible.** I don't optimize for older browsers (IE anyone?), but the interfaces I build are usually usable in those browsers. I just feel that a website does not need to look the same in every browser.
- **Accessible.** The products I work on are by default usable for assistive technology users such as screenreaders.
- **Progressively enhanced.** The front-end is using semantically marked up content, styled with modern CSS, and enhanced with JavaScript for interactivity.
- **Uses the latest in the front-end field.** New CSS, with possible fallbacks for older browsers.
- **Optimized for performance.** The experience feels lightweight and fast.

In other words I:

- **Write semantic HTML** with a strong focus on accessibility.
- **Craft modern CSS** that styles the visual aspects of the UI. From scalable typography to fully responsive and anything in between.
- **Author (presentational) JavaScript** that controls the interactivity within components.
- **Test accross devices and browsers**  to guarantee working functionality for all users.
- **Optimize for performance** to ensure a speedy and lightweight project.
