I hold myself to high standards, and provide value for the investment you make when hiring me. My work entails:

- Designing and creating websites.
- Semantic HTML.
- Modern, lightweight and scalable CSS (incl. Sass).
- Vanilla JavaScript (when needed: frameworks like React, Vue or Svelte).
- Accessible code
- Responsive design
- Progressive Web Apps (PWA)
- Build tools like Webpack, Gulp, NPM scripts
- Styleguide drive development (using tools like [Pattern Lab](https://patternlab.io/))
- Methods like scrum, Jira, TargetProcess, Trello, git, style- and JavaScript linters and other tools.

In other words I:

- **Write semantic HTML** with a strong focus on accessibility.
- **Craft modern CSS** that styles the visual aspects of the UI. From scalable typography to fully responsive and anything in between.
- **Author (presentational) JavaScript** that controls the interactivity within components.
- **Test accross devices and browsers**  to guarantee working functionality for all users.
- **Optimize for performance** to ensure a speedy and lightweight project.
