I’ve started contributing to the web around 2007 and worked with many different companies. These include agencies like [iO](https://www.iodigital.com), [E-sites](https://www.e-sites.nl/), [Freshheads](http://freshheads.com) and clients like [Eneco](http://eneco.com), [Government of the Netherlands](https://www.government.nl), [KNVB](http://knvb.nl), [Signify](https://www.signify.com) & [Dunea](http://dunea.nl).

I maintain some [repositories on GitHub](https://github.com/bramsmulders) and I’ve created [Supple Kit](https://github.com/supple-kit/). It is a collection of tools that enable speedy, accessible, and powerful web development.

Currently, I’m working as a freelance front-end UI developer at the [Government of the Netherlands](https://www.government.nl).

Since the beginning of 2019, I have also started producing electronic dance music.
