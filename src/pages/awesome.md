I’ve started contributing to the web around 2007 and worked with many different companies. These include agencies like [we are you](https://www.weareyou.com/), [E-sites](https://www.e-sites.nl/), [Freshheads](http://freshheads.com) and clients like [Eneco](http://eneco.com), [KNVB](http://knvb.nl), [Quinny](http://www.quinny.nl/), [Dunea](http://dunea.nl) & [Emerce](http://emerce.nl).

I maintain some [repositories on GitHub](https://github.com/bramsmulders) and I’ve created [Supple](https://github.com/supple-css/). It is a small but powerfull CSS framework designed specially with the latest browsers in mind.

Currently I’m employed as Senior UI developer at [we are you ’s-Hertogenbosch](https://www.weareyou.com). We have expertise in strategy, online marketing, customer journeys, design, development and managed hosting.

Since the beginning of this year I have also started producing hardstyle music.
You can [check out my website](https://djrebolo.com) and stream my music [on spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1SNDUhWRKHjgYZ56ktCSVL?si=ZfCC9lJtTHWQ0vvrjhpOVA) or on all other major platforms.
